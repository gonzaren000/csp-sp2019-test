      <h1>Peru, my country</h1>
      <h2> I’m Renzo Gonzalez, I’m 18 years old. I moved to Seattle almost three years ago with my parents and sisters. It was very hard because we left everything behind to start a new life in the US. What really helped me was joining the soccer team and spending time with my family and cousins. I was born in Lima, Peru. I really miss being there with all my friends. For my Final Project I decided to talk about my country because I very from when I come from and I would like to share a little bit about Peru. </p>
